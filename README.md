<p align="left">Hi, I'm Lucas! 👨‍💻 I'm an 19-year-old developer from Brazil, on an exciting journey into the world of full-stack development. 🌍✨<br><br>This GitHub is where I explore, experiment, and grow—testing my knowledge, learning new technologies, and building projects that reflect my progress. I'm passionate about both front-end and back-end development, and I'm constantly pushing myself to improve and master new skills. ⚡️<br><br>Currently, I'm focused on learning **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **Python** as I work towards my goal of becoming a skilled **back-end developer**. I'm also eager to dive into **mobile development** to broaden my expertise. 📱💻<br><br>My mission is simple: to become a versatile developer who creates innovative, efficient, and meaningful solutions. I believe in continuous learning and the power of experimentation. 💡🔧<br><br>Feel free to explore my projects, follow my journey, and let's inspire each other to keep growing! 🚀</p>
